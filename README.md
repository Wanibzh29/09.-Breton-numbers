# Breton-numbers
Here you will find a data-base for a Breton numbers macro, as these one: 

https://extensions.openoffice.org/fr/project/chiffres-en-lettres?SetFreedomCookie

It contains the variant form to count in Breton, from the traditionnal form, to the unusual one,
to the newest form in the 'new-breton'.

Could be very interesant to have a website which propose this kind of stuff in breton: https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/frnombre.php
