# Breton-numbers
I. Description 

- The project contains variant form to count in Breton, from the traditionnal form and most used, to the unusual one,
  to the newest form in the "new-breton" as thought to be more easy to learn in schools for francophone people but they are not recommanded to use because they are considered as difficult to understood.

II. How the project is organized?

* The project is organized like this:
- Each title of each file have in it letters as "A. 01. .., A. 02. ...". 
  If the filename containts "A." in it, it means that the forms contained in it are "classical ones to count in breton" so they will be most used.
  If the filename containts "B." in it, it means that it is rare forms.
  And if filename containts "Ch." in it, it means that it is the neologism forms to count into breton.
  If the filename containts "C'h" in it, it means that they are for particular case.
  In the future the some dialectical forms will be added and will have the as letter to distinguish them "D." in their filenames.
 

- The feminin forms to count in breton does have in their names after the letter the odd numbers, and the masculines evens numbers.
  I.e: 
    - A. 01. Classical way to count in breton femnin forms,
    - A. 02. Classical way to count in breton masculin forms,

IV. Some idea to reuse this project:

- Here you will find a data-base for a Breton numbers macro, as these one: https://extensions.openoffice.org/fr/project/chiffres-en-lettres?SetFreedomCookie

- Could be very interesant to have a website which propose this kind of stuff in breton: https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/frnombre.php

- The website: https://geriafurch.bzh/fr/nb propose this kind of stuff already.
